        expire_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):

        streams (Sequence[google.cloud.bigquery_storage_v1.types.ReadStream]):
            Output only. A list of streams created with the session.

            At least one stream is created with the session. In the

            strictly unique, but instead the same ID should
            be used to group logically connected sessions

        Attributes:

                Optional. The names of the fields in the table to be
                returned. If no field names are specified, then all fields
                in the table are returned.

                Nested fields -- the child elements of a STRUCT field -- can
                be selected individually using their fully-qualified names,
                and will be returned as record fields containing only the
                selected nested fields. If a STRUCT field is specified in
                the selected fields list, all of the child elements will be
                returned.

                As an example, consider a table with the following schema:

                { "name": "struct_field", "type": "RECORD", "mode":
                "NULLABLE", "fields": [ { "name": "string_field1", "type":
                "STRING", . "mode": "NULLABLE" }, { "name": "string_field2",
                "type": "STRING", "mode": "NULLABLE" } ] }

                Specifying "struct_field" in the selected fields list will
                result in a read session schema with the following logical
                structure:

                struct_field { string_field1 string_field2 }

                Specifying "struct_field.string_field1" in the selected
                fields list will result in a read session schema with the
                following logical structure:

                struct_field { string_field1 }

                The order of the fields in the read session schema is
                derived from the table schema and does not correspond to the
                order in which the fields are specified in this list.
            row_restriction (str):
                SQL text filtering statement, similar to a WHERE clause in a
                query. Aggregates are not supported.

                Examples: "int_field > 5" "date_field = CAST('2014-9-27' as
                DATE)" "nullable_field is not NULL" "st_equals(geo_field,
                st_geofromtext("POINT(2, 2)"))" "numeric_field BETWEEN 1.0
