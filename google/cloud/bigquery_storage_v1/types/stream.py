        expire_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):

            After this time, subsequent requests to read this Session
            will return errors. The expire_time is automatically
            assigned and currently cannot be specified or updated.

        table_modifiers (google.cloud.bigquery_storage_v1.types.ReadSession.TableModifiers):

            Optional. Read options for this session (e.g.
            column selection, filters).
        streams (Sequence[google.cloud.bigquery_storage_v1.types.ReadStream]):
            Output only. A list of streams created with the session.

            At least one stream is created with the session. In the
            future, larger request_stream_count values *may* result in
            this list being unpopulated, in that case, the user will
            need to use a List method to get the streams instead, which
            is not yet available.

            Output only. An estimate on the number of
            bytes this session will scan when all streams
            are completely consumed. This estimate is based
            on metadata from the table which might be
