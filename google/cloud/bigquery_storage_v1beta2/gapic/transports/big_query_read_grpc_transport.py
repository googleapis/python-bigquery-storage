        Creates a new read session. A read session divides the contents of a
        BigQuery table into one or more streams, which can then be used to read
        data from the table. The read session also specifies properties of the
        data to be read, such as a list of columns or a push-down filter describing
        the rows to be returned.

        A particular row can be read by at most one stream. When the caller has
        reached the end of each stream in the session, then all the data in the
        table has been read.

        Data is assigned to each stream such that roughly the same number of
        rows can be read from each stream. Because the server-side unit for
        assigning data is collections of rows, the API does not guarantee that
        each stream will return the same number or rows. Additionally, the
        limits are enforced based on the number of pre-filtered rows, so some
        filters can lead to lopsided assignments.

        Read sessions automatically expire 24 hours after they are created and do
        not require manual clean-up by the caller.
