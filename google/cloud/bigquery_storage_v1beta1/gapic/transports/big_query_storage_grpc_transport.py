        data from the table. The read session also specifies properties of the
        data to be read, such as a list of columns or a push-down filter describing
        the rows to be returned.

        reached the end of each stream in the session, then all the data in the

        returned streams can also be read from, and the total rows return by
        both child streams will be the same as the rows read from the original
        stream.

        Moreover, the two child streams will be allocated back to back in the
